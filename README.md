# Image outpainting using Diffusers

In this project, we're pushing the boundaries of outpainting using some of the latest techniques, including ControlNet, inpainting models, and diffusion-based pipelines.
We drew inspiration from OzzyGT's work on Hugging Face and combined some of the recent breakthroughs in diffusion models with controlled guidance mechanisms to achieve some really impressive outpainting results.
